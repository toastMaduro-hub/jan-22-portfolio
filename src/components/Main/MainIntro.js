              I fell in love with programming and I have at least learnt

              <br />I am proficient in languages and technologies like 
              <i>
                <b> Javascript and React.js </b>
              </i>
              <br />
              <br />
              I also like to mess with the backend using
              <i>
                <b> web technologies </b> like Node.js

              Learning new things is a general interest of mine, and when I decide I want to learn something I usually go all-in.
